As I already know about python I am only gonna list some major differences between C and Python.\
The differences that Proff Malan mentioned are as follows:

- In C we have to create **hash tables** but we already have them in python as **Dictionaries**.
- In python the indentation marks the scope of something whereas in C {curly brackets} are the one doing that.
- In C when we divide two integers and the ans is also the truncated int, but in python the ans is in float. So **NO TRUNCATION**.
- **Integer Overflow** is not a problem in python.Accurately measuring floating point still remains a problem tho.
