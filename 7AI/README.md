## Decision Trees 

As the name suggests tells about what decisions to take if this and if that, kinda like conditionals.
Basically we want to visualise all the possible cases we are taking into consideration, that is what might happen.\
This was a fine technique when used for simple stuff like Atari brick wall and ping pong automation by computer player for more complex stuff like Chess or Go or other games where the no of decisions after a certain moves is way too many in that case this are not useful. Enters **Machine Learning**.

### Reinforcement Learning 

This form of learning is based on how a certain task is performed. So if systems goes on the correct path for the solution it's rewarded and if not we somehow punish it. Just Basic **Indian Parenting** XD.
